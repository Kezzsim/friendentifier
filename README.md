# friendentifier
Some technical information not included in the description above.
We will be using TensorFlow to train a new network consisting only of Friend's images if we are able to gather enough, if not we will retrain Inception V3's higher layers to classify them.
The model will be publicly available for download and additionally there will be a Heroku site spun up to help friens be identified.
